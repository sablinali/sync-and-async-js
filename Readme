This is a presentation I gave in my bootcamp class to explain the main differences between js synchronous and asynchronous.
There are two pdf documents. One contains the slides of my presentation and the other one contains practical js codes to use in a console like JSitor in order to be able to see the sequence in which the functions are printed depending on whether they are synchronous or asynchronous js functions.
The presentation can also be seen in this link on canva.com:  https://www.canva.com/design/DAFTDMPz15s/1PvyXCjs7yJ0MDS5as7IAQ/edit
